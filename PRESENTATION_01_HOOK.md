## 1. Hook - Live Demo
**Duration: 2 minutes**

### Let's Start With Something Simple

```bash
$ ./HelloWorldCli
> /hello
World!
```

**That's it.** A CLI that responds to `/hello` with `World!`

**But wait...** what if we want:
- Type-safe arguments?
- Multiple commands?
- Reusable across projects?
- Proper error handling?
- Command pipelines?

**That's what we're building today.** 🚀

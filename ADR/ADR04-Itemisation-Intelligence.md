# Driving Clearer Itemisation

## Premise

YNAB philosophy typically falls into two camps that you can either both be a part of, or in any one: spending awareness and budgeting mindset. One drives the other, so that you can be fully aware of where your each penny is going to; to give it a different job next time around.

Spending awareness in YNAB only runs as deep as you allow, though the effort involved in really breaking down transactions beyond simply an amount to a company limits what you can identify from the purchases you're making. For those of us that will purchase something uneccessary as part of a neccessary transaction, this can hide waste in the small details.

## Problem
Having to go through YNAB and itemising each categorisation into specifics is time consuming, I'd to be able to apply sets of subtransactions I've created when previously itemising. 

## Solution
I can see this solution comprimising of three parts:

1. A way to store itemisation patterns for referring to later.
2. An itemisation pattern indexing service that looks at everything parent transaction with subtransactions, indexing a copy.
2. An itemisation pattern validating service, finding exact matches and automatically applying the pattern.

### Storing Samples
1. SpendingSample
2. SpendingSampleMatch
3. SpendingSampleMatchPrice

### Itemisation Pattern Indexing




## Constraints

### Not all patterns will match the total amount

### Being detailed for the sake of sample matching
Subtransactions must be fully formed.

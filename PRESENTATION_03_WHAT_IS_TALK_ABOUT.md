## 3. What Is This Talk About
**Duration: 5 minutes**

### The Problem: We Write Throwaway Scripts

A big part of moving forward as an engineering department is making those **small, intricate jobs** much faster.

**Common Scenario:**
- Unique task that doesn't belong in the product
- Need a quick tool to automate something
- Write a "throwaway" script
- Script becomes permanent
- Script becomes unmaintainable
- Script becomes a problem

### The Solution: Proper CLIs

We often solve these with **tooling** — writing quick little apps where:
- The task is unique enough
- Doesn't belong in the product
- Or there are bigger opportunities out there

**The CLI is a key tool in that space.**

### The Great Debate

**GitHub Desktop vs Git CLI** — the debate goes on today.

**The .NET Team** has embraced CLIs:
- `dotnet` CLI is the primary interface
- Entity Framework CLI tools
- Build and deployment tools

**Any big fan of grep** is willing to fight that corner too. 😄

### What We're Building

A **reusable CLI framework** that turns throwaway scripts into:
- **Maintainable** applications
- **Extensible** architecture
- **Type-safe** commands
- **Testable** components
- **Production-ready** tools
